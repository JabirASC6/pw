                   <strong>Video games: </strong> I have been playing video games for around 11 years now. I currently play fortnite(the most hated popular game ever) I am looking to expand my library but the video games that have come out recently are not good.

                    <strong>Video Making:</strong>  In my free time when I am not playing video games or doing school related things, I like to make videos and post them on youtube. I mostly post montages of my fortnite gameplay, I am very on and off with it though because it takes a very long time.

                    <strong>Coding: </strong>Recently I have started coding, this is a very new chapter of my life so I don't the most to say about it. But out of everything I do this is the thing that I want to turn into a career. To nurture this hobby I have gone to camps such as All Star Code.
